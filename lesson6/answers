1. When we use virtualization, we have hypervisor in host machine, and it distributes resources between VM. VM has its OS, its disk volume (it's a file in host machine), RAM that hypervisor give form host's RAM etc.
Containerization is a technology when all containers use one kernel - kernel from host's OS. Container isolated from other using built-in functions of OS.

2. Container use less disk space.
   Container start faster then VM. It's important in case of re-load crashed app.
   Distribution app in container is easier then using VM.

3. When something happens with kernel, it affects all container in machine.

4. It's usefull for microservice architecture.
